# File Formats 
There are a number of input files that OPS requires to operate successfully. Before executing simulations,
these files have to be created manually using any text editor. Here are the files and the formats.


Locations File (locations.txt)
------------------------------

This file holds the locations used by ExtendedSWIMMobility mobility model.


|  Field     |  Data Type    |           Description                         |
|  :---:     |   :---:       |              :---                             |
|  X coord   |     double    | X coordinate of the location.                 |
|  Y coord   |     double    | Y coordinate of the location.                 |
|  Z coord   |     double    | Z coordinate of the location.                 |
|  num nodes |      int      | Number of nodes at location. Always zero.     |

The X, Y and Z coordinates are in the cartesian format and in meters. Here are the contents of an example file with 4 locations.

```
 50 100 0 0
 50 50 0 0
 100 50 0 0
 100 100 0 0
```

Events File (events.txt)
------------------------

This file holds the different events (and their details) that would be generated by the event generator.

|  Field      |  Data Type    |           Description                                              |
|  :---:      |     :---:     |               :---                                                 |
|  keyword(s) |     string    | Set of keywords associated with an event, separated by a space. Either emergency or other keywords  |
|  X coord    |     double    | X coordinate of the event location in meters (Cartesian).          |
|  Y coord    |     double    | Y coordinate of the event location in meters (Cartesian).          |
|  Z coord    |     double    | Z coordinate of the event location in meters (Cartesian).          |
|  radius     |     double    | If an emergency, then the radius (affected area) in meters (with an `m` appended). This value is only used if emergency type event. |
|  start time |     double    | Event start time.                                                  |
|  end time   |     double    | Event end time.                                                    |
|  popularity |     double    | Popularity assigned to the event (with a `p` appended)             |

Here are the contents of an example file with 6 events.

```
 emergency 50 100 0 20m 5 10 100p
 shopping music 100 100 0 20 30 100p
 emergency 100 100 0 20m 10 18 100p
 emergency 50 50 0 10m 50 100 100p
 music 100 50 0 100 150 75p
 shopping indoor celebration 50 100 0 300 400 50p
```

Keywords File (properties.txt)
------------------------------

This file contains lines of keywords that would be associated with a node. The user behaviour model randomly
picks a line and assigns to the nodes.

|  Field      |  Data Type    |           Description                                                      |
|  :---:      |   :---:       |               :---                                                         |
|  keywords   |     string    | Set of keywords that can be associated with a node, separated by a space.  |


Here are the contents of an example file with 6 combinations of keywords.

```
 wedding music
 celebration shopping
 music jazz rock pop classic
 park outdoor food
```
