# Collected Statistics

There are different statistics collected by OPS during a simulation. These statistics
are available at the **Node level** and **Network level**. Further, these statistics
are generated from the different protocol layers of every node model. Information 
about each of these statistics are given below.

## Statistics from the Application Layer
