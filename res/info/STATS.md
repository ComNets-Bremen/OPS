# Collected Results (Statistics)

There are different statistics collected by OPS during a simulation. These statistics
are available at the **Node level** and at the **Network level**. Statistics are initiated 
from different protocol layers of a node model. There are two types of statistics 
collected.

1. Vector statistics - These are the continuous statistics that are collected. These 
results can be plotted as graphs.

2. Scalar statistics - These are the measures of dispersion type statistics collected. In 
OPS, we only collect the **final value** of a scalar statistic.

Information about each of these statistics are given below.

## Statistics from the Application Layer

The table below lists the statistics generated from the application layer.

## Statistics from the Forwarding Layer

The table below lists the statistics generated from the forwarding layer. Since different
forwarding layer protocols operation differently, they may not produce all the statistics
list below.

| Statistic Name              |         Description          | Collected Level |
| --------------              |         -----------          | --------------- |
